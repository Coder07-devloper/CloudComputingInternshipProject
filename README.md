#Project1â€“ Leveraging Elastic Beanstalk and Host Full Stack Application
<br>
In this project, I deployed a full-stack application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, an easy-to-use service for deploying and managing applications in the cloud. The application consists of a React.js frontend and a Node.js backend with Express and MongoDB, providing a seamless user experience with dynamic data handling.  
<br>
To ensure smooth deployment and scalability, I utilized Elastic Beanstalk's automated environment provisioning, handling load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. I configured the deployment using AWS CLI and Elastic Beanstalk CLI, streamlining the process.  
<br>
Key tools and technologies used in this project:  
- Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS  
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Atlas)  
- Deployment: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS S3 for static asset storage  
- Database Management: MongoDB Atlas, AWS RDS (for optional relational storage)  
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated deployments  
- Security & Monitoring: AWS IAM roles, CloudWatch for logging and monitoring  

This project strengthened my skills in cloud deployment, DevOps automation, and full-stack development, enabling me to efficiently deploy and manage scalable web applications.
 All the code, and other assets that I have used in making the projects are mentioned in the project file-"INTERNSHIP LIVE PROJECT 1 FILE".
